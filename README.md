# Updates for Meteor's Underscore

Meteor uses a version of Underscore forked from (as of 6/5/2015) 1.5.1. There's been a
lot of good stuff added to Underscore since then! This package extends the `_` variable with selected
functions from the latest version of Underscore, copied from its source.

## Adding

Add this to your app with:

```
meteor add mixmax:underscore-updates
```

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions! This package only contains the functions needed by Mixmax at present,
but additions are welcome.
